## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamP231004/Umbrella-Customizer
cd Umbrella-Customizer
```

2. Place your base umbrella image in the project's root folder and name it exactly:

```
image.png
```

*(For best results, use a **transparent PNG** of your umbrella design. The base image should show the umbrella fabric and texture with the rest of the canvas transparent.)*

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser, either by using a command or by dragging the file into a browser window.

```bash
open index.html
```
